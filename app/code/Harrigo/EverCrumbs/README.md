# EverCrumbs
Creates a breadcrumb trail when searching for products or if you have a warm up script so breadcrumbs are always present rather than normally where they can get cached without a trail.

# Compatability
Currently works on Magento 2.2.5 and below.

Any issues please contact me or post an issue and I will try and resolve as soon as possible.
